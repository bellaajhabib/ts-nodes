const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
// Only one state Allowed
});

console.log(typeof myPromise);

// Another Syntax

const theResolved = (resolved: any) => {
  console.log(resolved);
};
const therejected = (rejected: any) => {
  console.log(rejected);
};

myPromise.then(theResolved, therejected);
